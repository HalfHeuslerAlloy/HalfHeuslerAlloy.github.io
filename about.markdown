I'm currently a postdoc researcher at the University of Leeds, working on integrating THz radiation into a milli-kelvin fridge. My past work was on half Heusler alloys as systems for topological materials.

This site has a collection of hobby projects I've worked on that I find interesting.

This site was created with jekyll and is hosted by [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) !
