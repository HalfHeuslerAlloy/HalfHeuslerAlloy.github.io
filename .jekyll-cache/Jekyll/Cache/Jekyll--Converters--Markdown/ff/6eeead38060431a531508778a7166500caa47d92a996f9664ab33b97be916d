I"A<p>Did you know you can get a microcontroller in a 6-pin SOT-23 format? Well,  PIC10F320’s are smaller than a grain of rice and not nearly as tasty. As to be expected you don’t get much in them with only 256 words of program space and 64 bytes of register space of which only half is usable as general memory storage. But with an internal clock running at 16MHz and an instruction speed of 4MHz we are just fast enough to output Pal/NTSC video by bit bashing a tristate IO pin connected to a couple of resistors. So lets try to implement Conway’s game of life (GOL)!</p>
