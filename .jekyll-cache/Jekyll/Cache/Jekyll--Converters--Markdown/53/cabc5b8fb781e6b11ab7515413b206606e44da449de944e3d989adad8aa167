I"+<p>Did you know you can get a microcontroller in a 6-pin SOT-23 format? PIC10F320’s are smaller than a grain of rice and not nearly as tasty. As to be expected you don’t get much in them with only 256 words of program space and 64 bytes of register space of which only half is usable as general memory storage. FYI, it is words and not bytes of program space since each instruction in PIC10 series is 12 bits so the actual program size is 384 bytes, but since each instruction is indivisible it is better expressed as a word for each instruction.</p>
